      <p class="book-description">
        It tells the story of a troubled man incapable of revealing
                  his true self to others, and who, instead, maintains a facade
                  of hollow jocularity, later turning to a life of alcoholism
                  and drug abuse before his final disappearance. The original
                  title translates as "Disqualified as a human being" or "A
                  failed human".
